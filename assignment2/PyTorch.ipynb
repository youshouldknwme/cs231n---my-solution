You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input
